# Introduction


The Bittensor Subnet 10 (Map Reduce Subnet) incentivizes miners by offering rewards for contributing network bandwidth and memory resources.

A broadcast subnet leverages the bandwidth of multiple peers to transfer large data from point to A to multiple point Bs without needing to leverage large quantities of your own upload. The concept is simple, a large file D can be split into multiple chunks and sent to N intermediate peers (usually with redundancy) and then forwarded onward to B additional endpoints in an N by B full bipartite fashion. The inverse operation is also valuable, where data DxB large data files can be aggregated from B peers by leveraging the bandwidth of N intermediaries. 

In the forward 'map' operation a file D is broken into chunks and split across the N peers each of whom then forwards their chunk to B endpoints allowing each downloading peer to recieve the full file of size D with the sending peer needing an upload of only size D. The backward operation, 'reduce', acts in reverse, the K receiving peers fan out their response data D in chunks to the N intermediary peers who then aggregate the chunks from each other and finally send the sum of total chunks back to the sending peer A. 

The map-reduce cycle is essential for reducing the bandwidth by a factor of K on the running peers which is essential for the training of machine learning models in a distributed setting. This template is a protoype for incentivizing the speed at which this operation can take place by validating both the consistency and operation speed of a map-reduce.

# How it works
![Map Reduce Diagram](map_reduce.svg)

The diagram illustrates the workflow of a distributed map-reduce system with an integrated validation mechanism:

Peer Gradient Splitting:

Peers do machine training and generate unique gradients.
These gradients are divided into segments (Seg1, Seg2, Seg3 in the diagram), which are then distributed among the miners (Miner1, Miner2, Miner3 in the diagram).

Miner Gradient Processing:

Each miner receives segments from the peers. The miners perform computations on these segments, which could involve averaging, sum or other forms of data processing.
After processing, each miner holds an averaged gradient segment, denoted as g^ (1) for Miner1, g^ (2) for Miner2, and g^ (3) for Miner3.

Gradient Broadcasting and Aggregation:

The miners then broadcast their processed gradient segments back to all peers.
Each peer collects these averaged gradient segments, reconstructing the full set of averaged gradients, which could then be used for further computations or iterations within a larger algorithm.

Validation:

A validator independently samples small subsets of data from both the peers and the miners.
The validator's role is to confirm that the miners' computations are accurate and that the integrity of the data remains intact through the process.
This system ensures the distributed processing of data with a check-and-balance system provided by the validator. This validation step is crucial for maintaining the reliability of the distributed computation, especially in decentralized or trustless environments where the computation's correctness cannot be taken for granted.

# Installation
This repository requires python3.8 or higher. To install, simply clone this repository and install the requirements.

## Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dream-well/map-reduce-subnet
cd map-reduce-subnet
python -m pip install -e .
```


# Running Miner

## Prerequisites

For running a miner, you need enough resources.
The minimal requirements for running a miner are 

- Public IP address
- Network bandwidth: 1Gbps
- RAM: 10GB

Recommended hardware requirement:
- Network bandwidth: 10Gbps
- RAM: 32GB

Note: Higher network bandwidth and RAM can lead to more rewards.

## Running Miner Script

Run the miner using the following script:

```bash
# To run the miner
python3 neurons/miner.py
    --netuid 10  # The subnet id you want to connect to
    --subtensor.network finney  # blockchain endpoint you want to connect
    --wallet.name <your miner wallet> # name of your wallet
    --wallet.hotkey <your miner hotkey> # hotkey name of your wallet
    --logging.debug # Run in debug mode, alternatively --logging.trace for trace mode
```

Important Note: Operating multiple miners from a single machine (using the same IP address) may result in reduced rewards. For optimal performance and reward maximization, it is recommended to run each miner on a separate machine.

# Running Validator

Validators oversee data transfer processes and ensure the accuracy and integrity of data transfers.

## Prerequisites

1. (Optional) I recommend to run subtensor instance locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor.git
cd subtensor
docker compose up --detach
```

2. For validating, you need to setup benchmark bots first.

### Setup Benchmark Bots
VValidators should set up at least 10 benchmark bots (more bots lead to faster validation). 
Each bot should run on a different machine with a minimum of 24GB RAM and 1Gbps network bandwidth.

Minimum hardware requirement:
- RAM: 24GB
- Network: 1Gbps

Recommended hardware requirement:
- RAM: 32GB
- Network: 10Gbps

```bash
# To run the benchmark bot
python3 neurons/benchmark.py
    --netuid 10  # The subnet id you want to connect to
    --subtensor.network local  # blockchain endpoint you want to connect
    --wallet.name <your benchmark wallet> # name of your wallet
    --wallet.hotkey <your benchmark hotkey> # hotkey name of your wallet, you can create a new wallet for benchmark and register in validator.config.json
    --logging.debug # Run in debug mode, alternatively --logging.trace for trace mode
```

## Configuration with validator.config.json

Modify validator.config.json with appropriate settings, including hotkeys for benchmark bots.

```bash
cp example.validator.config.json validator.config.json
```

```json
{
	"subtensor.network": "local",
	"netuid": 10,
	"wallet.name": "your wallet name",
	"wallet.hotkey": "your validator hotkey",
	"max_bandwidth": 10737418240,
	"benchmark_hotkeys": [
		"",
		"",
		"",
		"",
		"",
		"",
		"",
		"",
		"",
		""
	]
}
```

- max_bandwidth: The maximum bandwidth of your benchmark bots. (default 10 Gb)
- benchmark_hotkeys: The hotkeys of your benchmark bots. (default 5 bots)

## Running Validator Script

```bash
cd neurons
# To run the validator
python validator.py 
    --netuid 10 # The subnet id you want to connect to
    --subtensor.network local # blockchain endpoint you want to connect
    --wallet.name <your validator wallet>  # name of your wallet
    --wallet.hotkey <your validator hotkey> # hotkey name of your wallet
    --logging.debug # Run in debug mode, alternatively --logging.trace for trace mode
```

## User Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dream-well/map-reduce-subnet
cd map-reduce-subnet
python -m pip install -e .
```

```python
import torch
import time
from peer.peer import Peer
import bittensor as bt
from argparse import ArgumentParser

parser = ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--validator.uid', type = int, default= 0, help='Validator UID')
parser.add_argument('--netuid', type = int, default=10, help='Map Reduce Subnet NetUID')
parser.add_argument('--rank', type = int, default=1, help='Rank of the peer')
parser.add_argument('--count', type = int, default=1, help='Number of peers')

config = bt.config(
    parser=parser
)

wallet = bt.wallet(config=config)

# size for testing, set to 100 MB
test_size = 100 * 1024 * 1024

def train(rank, peer_count, bandwidth, wallet, validator_uid, netuid, network ):
    bt.logging.info(f"🔷 Starting peer with rank {rank} netuid: {netuid}")
    # Initialize Peer instance
    peer = Peer(rank, peer_count, bandwidth, wallet, validator_uid, netuid, network)

    # Initialize process group with the fetched configuration
    peer.init_process_group()

    weights = None

    if rank == 1: # if it is the first peer
        weights = torch.rand((int(test_size / 4), 1), dtype=torch.float32)
        peer.broadcast(weights)
    else:
        weights = peer.broadcast(weights)

    epoch = 2

    # Your training loop here
    bt.logging.info(f"Peer {rank} is training...")    
    for i in range(epoch):

        bt.logging.success(f"🟢 Epoch: {i}")
        # Replace this with actual training code
        time.sleep(5)
        
        # After calculating gradients
        gradients = torch.ones((int(test_size / 4), 1), dtype=torch.float32)
        if rank == 1:
            gradients = torch.ones((int(test_size / 4), 1), dtype=torch.float32) * 3

        # All-reducing the gradients
        gradients = peer.all_reduce(gradients)
    
    peer.destroy_process_group()
    print(f"Peer {rank} has finished training.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    train(config.rank, config.peer_count, test_size, wallet, config.validator.uid, config.netuid, config.subtensor.network)

```

User also can test the map-reduce subnet by running test.py
```bash
python3 test/test.py --subtensor.network local --wallet.name <wallet name> --wallet.hotkey <hotkey name> --validator.uid <validator uid>
```
